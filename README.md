# Functional Diversity of Italian Forests

In general, this project will use data from the Italian National Forest Inventory [https://www.inventarioforestale.org/en] to examine functional diversity of forests across abiotic gradients in Italy.  The raw data has been downloaded from the INFC website.

**Main research questions**
- What is the relationship between habitat suitability (estimated from SDMs) and abundance, growth, biomass, and deviation from community-mean traits for trees in Italy?
- How does functional composition and diversity of forest trees vary with respect to abiotic gradients in Italy?
- How does distribution (in geographic vs. environmental space) differ for seedlings vs adults?
- How does functional composition / diversity of seedlings vs. adult trees differ?
